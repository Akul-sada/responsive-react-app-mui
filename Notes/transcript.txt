hello my friends today we are gonna design this beautiful website using material ui you are gonna learn how to
0:07
use the most common material ui components by creating a real world project
0:13
cards lists models icons and more and also you will
0:19
learn how to create your own themes how to customize styles
0:24
and how to build your own components then we'll go ahead and create a dark mode
0:31
team and we're gonna do this in just a minute it's an awesome project to learn
0:36
new mui and this project will be mobile responsive you'll see how easy to create
0:42
responsive designs using mui and finally we are gonna deploy this website using a
0:48
hosting service and as always we will be using hostinger it's one of the most
0:54
popular hosting providers and the sponsor of this video it's really cheap really fast and i
1:01
really love its user-friendly dashboard you can deploy all your websites in one
1:06
hosting you will have more than enough storage but the best thing is you are
1:11
gonna get a free domain and free ssl certificate at this price
1:16
you can choose any time period here and if you use the link in the description below or la model coupon code here you
1:25
are gonna get an extra discount after choosing the payment methods and purchasing you are gonna redirect it to
1:32
hostinger panel and as you can see i have chosen the business shared hosting
1:38
so let's claim our free domain and set up our hosting i'm gonna write a domain
1:44
name if it's available you will be able to register and it's ready
1:50
so let's set up the hosting i'll choose start from scratch
1:56
and i'll select my new domain we can finish the setup it's gonna take a while and right after
2:03
that you are gonna see your panel and you are ready you can manage your
2:09
domains your files and you are gonna see how easy to deploy any application using
2:15
this file manager so if you are ready let's create our website and deploy it
2:21
here okay i created a new folder and i'm
2:27
gonna create a react app to do that i will open my terminal and
2:32
right here mpx create react app
2:37
and i want to install everything here so i will say dodge and enter during this
2:42
process let's check out the new material ui page it's not material ui anymore
2:48
it's mui they have changed its name and the website now it's much clearer and
2:55
more effective i really love this version it's one of my favorite after this tutorial i
3:01
believe that it's gonna be yours too so let's get started so we are going to
3:07
install mui to do that there are two options we should use a styling library to run
3:14
material ui so you can either use emotion or style components you are
3:19
probably familiar with style components but there's a problem here if you create any ssr project it might
3:27
cause some problems that's why they are using emotion as a default library so we
3:33
are gonna use emotion2 so i will copy here if you are using npm
3:39
just copy this line if you are using yarn like me copy this line and don't worry about
3:45
emotion you are gonna see that it's working like style components so let's come here i'm gonna paste here
3:52
it's gonna install and let's see what else as you can see mui is using this font
3:59
family by default we can do the same thing i can copy this and paste into index.html
4:05
and one more thing we are gonna install and it's gonna be mui icons if you check
4:11
the icons page as you can see there are tons of beautiful icons here
4:17
so we will be able to use all those icons so let's come back
4:22
firstly i'm gonna install my font family here by the way we should clean here
4:30
but before i'm gonna paste my link and here i'm gonna create a style
4:37
and inside i'm gonna choose all document and font family will be roboto
4:43
okay let's install these icons and after that we can get started i will copy here
4:51
and paste let's run our application npm start or
4:58
we unstart and as you can see it's ready let's clean here and everything will be
5:05
easier firstly we don't have any icon i will delete this theme
5:11
here and those comments and here
5:18
i can delete these those logos it's going to be only index.html and
5:24
here we don't need any css test file it's going to be only app.js and
5:30
index.js and finally inside application i'm going to delete them
5:37
and of course inside index.js i'm gonna
5:42
delete this css and here and that's all okay
5:49
like that and as you can see there is a default space here i'm going to delete this
5:55
and i can come here and say margin 0 and that's all we can get
6:00
started i'm going to close here and my sidebar let's see how we can use it as you can
6:07
see we are using mui elements like that we are importing and using as a
6:13
component actually let's open up buttons
6:18
here and here as you can see we have different kinds of buttons here let's
6:25
copy them and paste here i'm going to come here and delete the last letter and i will write again as
6:32
you can see it provides all those libraries we are gonna use material ui button
6:38
like that i will save and as you can see they are here
6:44
first one is only text this is content and this is outline only with order so
6:51
you can give any attribute like disabled href let's say disabled
6:57
for this and as you can see you don't have to worry about any styling and we can
7:03
change their colors let's say color primary
7:09
actually it's primary by default and let's change and right here
7:16
secondary and as you can see it's purple right now purple is a weird choice as a
7:22
secondary color but anyway you will learn how to change these colors and also we can give any
7:29
size large medium or small let's make small
7:34
and like that and also we can give any icon for our buttons as you can see we
7:40
are writing start icon and passing our icon let's choose any icon here i will say
7:48
settings i'm gonna choose field here okay we can use this one as you can see
7:53
you can import it like that and i will say start icon
8:00
and it's going to be settings icon like that it's that easy
8:07
let's create one more icon here and let's change this color it's going
8:13
to be success for example and this icon will be
8:19
let's say add we can use this one if you don't want to copy and paste
8:24
again and again basically you can choose this name and write it here
8:31
add and as you can see i will click and it comes from icons material
8:36
i can do the same thing for this one instead of writing them in different lines i would just say
8:43
settings and let's delete this one and in this case it's going to be just settings
8:51
settings and add new post for example okay perfect
8:58
so i'm gonna add a text here to do that we are gonna use mui typography
9:05
i will come here and as you can see we don't need to import any font source that because we have already installed
9:12
in index.html so don't worry about that so what i'm gonna do is using typography
9:19
component and giving its type as you can see it's h1 so what's this component
9:25
basically it takes tile from h1 but it's gonna be actually h2 let me show you you
9:32
are gonna understand better i'm gonna copy here and let's paste i'm gonna import and component will be
9:40
let's say p it uses h1 style but it's a p tag
9:47
okay as you can see it's really huge but if i open elements here inside my do
9:54
my buttons and as you can see it's a p tag of course in most cases we are not using
10:00
any components you can just delete here i just wanted to show you so far so good
10:06
but if i want to change this color i didn't like this purple there are many
10:12
ways to do that but the easiest one is writing an inner style
10:17
let's create another button here button and i will say my unique button
10:26
and variant will be contained again and what i'm gonna do is keeping here as x
10:32
property and inside i can write any style let's say background color
10:37
it's gonna be sky blue for example and what else i can say
10:42
text color is gonna be this light gray i can give any margin by the way if you
10:48
are using material ui you can use this shortcut also you can directly say m
10:54
but let's use margin and it's gonna be five and let's see first and later we
11:00
can add more and as you can see it's here but when i hover over as you can see
11:06
this blue color is still here and we are going to change it i'm just going to write
11:12
hover and my style inside i will say background color again
11:20
and that's a light blue okay perfect i can do the same thing for
11:26
disabled attribute for example let's give comma first and i will say
11:32
disabled background color will be font color will be white
11:40
of course we should make it disabled first and that's all this is how we are
11:46
applying our own style let's leave this disabled and what if i want to create
11:51
one more button same button like that okay it's here but writing them like
11:57
that again and again is not a good idea so what we can do basically we can create
12:04
our own button component here and here is how we can use motion or style
12:09
components so i will say const blue button and i will say styled it's gonna be mui
12:18
and material i'm gonna choose this and inside i can select any mui
12:23
component or html element let's say button and here we are gonna just write our
12:30
styles let's copy here like that and paste here so i can use it
12:37
everywhere let's delete them i'll say blue button
12:42
my button and one more let's say another button
12:48
and it's that easy so if you are using the same color in multiple components
12:54
you don't have to write them in every component like that basically you can create your own team let's come here and
13:01
i'm gonna say team.js and here i'm gonna create my team i will
13:07
say export const theme and here i'm gonna use
13:13
create tv raw material ui and inside this i can create my own shapes on
13:20
colors let's check here customization and teaming and as you can see palette
13:27
object is where we are storing our colors as you can see primary secondary success
13:33
error or your custom color let's do that i will say palette and i
13:39
want to change my primary color and you can give any other variants inside for
13:44
example main disk color light i don't know sky blue whatever you want
13:51
let's do the same thing for secondary it's gonna be this color and also you
13:58
can create your own color let's say other color and name will be
14:04
this gray color if i come here and check as you can see nothing has changed that because we are
14:11
not using our team for this application basically you can come here and wrap all
14:16
your application with team provider and you can do the same thing for index.js by the way
14:23
this is how react 18 works we are not using react render anymore it's going be
14:29
create root so if you want to upgrade your react version make sure that your index.js looks like this otherwise you
14:37
might see any errors in your console okay anyway so what i'm gonna do is creating here
14:44
team provider from material and i'm gonna wrap my application
14:49
like that and finally i'm gonna import my team let's import this
14:56
import team from team file
15:02
okay i can use it here and after this as you can see our secondary
15:09
color has changed it was purple but right now it's green so if i come here
15:14
and change its color it was secondary let's make my other
15:20
color what was the name okay other color
15:25
like that as you can see it's grey now you can do the same thing for your
15:31
custom button here and here you should write your team
15:37
and let's close here and we can use our theme right now i will say
15:43
theme dot palette and other color
15:48
and main color of course and as you can see it's here it's that
15:54
easy so we can delete this you don't need any provider right now
16:00
but later you are gonna see how easy to create dark mode with this team and i'm
16:05
gonna take this back and right now you know the basics of
16:12
material ui of course i'm not gonna explain all those components here i think it's
16:18
pretty clear you will just copy and paste them i see a lot of tutorials just showing
16:25
all those components but if you are smart enough to use react probably you
16:30
know how to copy and paste them so what i want to do is showing you a
16:36
real world project we are gonna create a website we are gonna use the most common
16:41
components we are gonna give our styles you are gonna learn how to create responsive websites how to pass props
16:49
inside material ui styles so if you are ready let's clear here and start making
16:56
our project i'm gonna write everything
17:01
and this and those imports okay
17:07
everything from scratch so what we are gonna have we are gonna have another bar
17:12
here and after that we are gonna have three columns first one will be our sidebar second one
17:18
will be feet which includes our posts and last one will be right bar let's
17:24
create our components i will come here and say components
17:30
narrowbar jazz or jsx sidebar
17:39
feed and finally right bar
17:44
let's create our functions
17:52
sidebar feet and
17:57
right bar okay so before creating our number i want to show you how you can
18:03
use flexbox so firstly we are going to create our sidebar fit and write bar i
18:09
will close them and open up my app.js again my components sidebar feet
18:16
and right bar let's import them
18:22
components and sidebar feet and right brush
18:32
let's see as you can see they are here okay so how we are gonna use flexbox
18:39
because each component here will be different columns we are gonna have a flexbox container so let's see how you
18:46
can create flexbox container if you scroll through this menu bar you are gonna see layouts
18:53
first layout will be box basically it's like html div there is nothing special
18:59
we are just gonna wrap our components so what else here we have container it said div again but
19:07
it has some default margin let's try them actually so instead of do i will
19:12
say first box from material ui and as you can see
19:18
nothing has changed because it's acting like a dew so what else we have container
19:30
and as you can see there is a space here let's give background color and you can understand better
19:39
i'll say red there is a default margin and padding and its width is horizontal like that
19:47
it's a hundred percent so what else we have we have grid system here as you can see
19:54
if you want to create grid system you can use this component but there is something important here its name is
20:01
grid but it uses css flexbox actually it's not using css grid
20:07
this is why flexbox is really important this is why i'm using flexbox for my all
20:14
projects if you are using react react native you have to know how flexbox
20:19
works okay we don't need this that because we are not creating any two dimensions grid
20:25
system like that so let's check stack it's a grid system but it's only one
20:33
dimension it can be vertical or horizontal if it's vertical it's going
20:38
to be only one column if it's horizontal it's going to be only one row as you can
20:44
see we have direction here and we can't give any spacing between them
20:50
or you can add any dividers let's create this firstly i'm gonna take this back
20:56
and it's gonna be a box that's because we are gonna create our network here later let's write here
21:04
navbar we are gonna use it later and for those components i'm gonna
21:09
create a stack let's say stack from material ui
21:14
and i'm gonna wrap my components here like that and it's gonna be horizontal so i will
21:22
say traction as you can see column column reverse row and row reverse just like
21:28
flexbox i'm gonna choose raw they are horizontal right now so let's
21:34
give some spacing let's say two
21:39
as you can see some space between them you can also use align items or justify
21:45
content if i say justify content and center
21:51
they are going to be centered like that space between
21:56
is going to separate them like that basically you can give any flexbox
22:01
property here like that so we are using space between so if i
22:07
give those components any colors you can understand better i think
22:12
let's make them box also and i will use sx or i can use any
22:18
shortcut like background color and let's say sky
22:24
blue so i will do the same thing for feet and right bar
22:30
it's gonna be box background color let's say pink and for
22:36
right bar
22:41
box and background color let's say light coral for example
22:48
okay perfect as you can see they don't have any width remember how we are using flexbox we can directly give any
22:55
percentage just like with 20 percent is 50 percent but the efficient way is
23:02
using flex so for the sidebar it's gonna be flex 1
23:09
let's copy this 4 feet is going to be flex let's say 4
23:15
is going to be bigger and for the right side it's going to be 2.
23:21
sidebar is one unit feed is four times bigger than sidebar and right bar is two
23:26
times bigger than sidebar it's that easy by the way we can give some padding for
23:32
each how we can do this if i say p as you can see there is a shortcut here
23:38
i can directly just say two for others
23:45
two and padding too
23:51
like that awesome but what if we use any mobile phone if i open my console and click
23:58
here it's still same but for mobile screens it's not a good idea to see all those
24:05
elements here so what we can do we can basically delete this sidebar and right bar and we
24:11
can see only our feed just like instagram or facebook to do that we are
24:17
gonna use material ui breakpoints let's search for it i will say
24:23
breakpoints as you can see there is a default breakpoint here so we can use extra
24:28
small from 0 to 600 pixels it's going to be small from 600 to 900
24:36
medium from 900 to 1200 it works like that of course if you want
24:42
to use different breakpoints you can customize it you can create your own team and as you
24:49
can see our object will be breakpoints and you can change those breakpoints for
24:54
example you can make this 480 690 whatever you want it depends on you but
25:01
i'm gonna use the default one in this case if it's smaller than 600 pixels
25:06
it's going to be extra small so we can use this key so what i'm gonna do is
25:12
creating inner style like that and i'm gonna write here my condition i
25:17
will say if it's extra small just make it display now i'm gonna close my
25:23
sidebar by the way you can see better and i will say if it's small screen or
25:28
bigger it's gonna be display block or whatever you want
25:34
let's see right now i'm gonna open here again and as you can see we don't have sidebar anymore
25:42
i can do the same thing for right bar let's copy this line and paste it here
25:51
okay perfect only feed is here but if i open my desktop version it's gonna be
25:57
like that let's move this a little bit if it's under 600 it's going to be extra small
26:04
like that i'm coming coming and that's all it
26:10
works like that of course for tablets for small screens you can create another breakpoints but
26:17
for this tutorial i just want to show you the basics so we are ready to create our
26:24
number let's close them and i will say navbar
26:31
of course we should use it here bar i can delete this container by the way we are not using okay let's see how
26:39
we can create i will open up components and
26:46
app bar there are different kinds of app bars here you can use whatever you want but this
26:53
one looks pretty good i'm gonna use this but if you open source code you might be
26:59
a little bit confused that because there are many things here
27:05
of course we are not gonna copy paste anything i'm gonna show you the easiest way don't worry
27:12
let's see what it's using here okay here as you can see it's using box
27:20
it gives as x here but you can directly write flags also as we did before and
27:25
after that it creates upper and inside this add bar container we are gonna have
27:31
a toolbar basically it gives some default margin and padding of course you
27:36
can create here a stack as we did here and we can say put here our logo for the
27:41
center put maybe search input for the right side are icons but let's
27:48
go with this way so you can understand how it works so instead of tier i will
27:53
say apple and as you can see it has our primary
27:59
code and if i add inside toolbar
28:05
and wrap this text like that as you can see it gives this padding but
28:11
as you realize we cannot see our other components that because we didn't give any position for this upper
28:18
so i will say position you can give any css positioning for example static if
28:24
you do that you will be able to see other components and also you can say for example sticky
28:31
so in this case even if we scroll down on this screen now bar will be always on
28:37
the top so let's use this one and after that we are going to create our logo search bar
28:43
and icons to do that i want to use display flags again so we can use our
28:49
own toolbar so i will say const style toolbar
28:56
styled from material and it's gonna be a toolbar and i'm gonna say display flex
29:04
and again i'm gonna separate them so i will say justify content it's gonna be
29:09
space between so instead of toolbar i'm going to use this one
29:15
like that so let's create our logo it's going to be a text
29:20
let's say lamar tao and i'm going to give some variant here and it's gonna be
29:26
h6 like that perfect so let's make this responsive if i open my console again
29:33
oops i said stick it's gonna be sticky okay
29:38
so i'm going to open mobile screen here and as you can see it's really large right now if i add here search button or
29:46
any other icons they are going to be overflowing to prevent this let's think what we can do basically instead of this
29:53
text we can add some image or icon let's come here i'm not sure if there is
30:00
a llama or not okay there is no maybe pet okay this one is good pets we
30:07
are going to use this one so what i'm going to do is creating here my icon i'm going to import this
30:13
like that and again i'm going to use my slides here
30:18
again i will say display and for x small it's gonna be no
30:25
and if it's small or bigger than small it's gonna be block
30:30
and i will do the same thing for my icon i will copy this and paste here but this
30:36
time it's gonna be block and no and as you can see our logo is here
30:43
let's close here and i'm gonna shrink perfect
30:50
if it's small screen icon if it's bigger perfect so what else we are gonna need
30:55
we are gonna need a search bar so let's use something different here and i'm
31:01
gonna show you how you can use htmld const search bar or just search and it's
31:08
gonna be styled again but inside you can use any div element like that
31:14
and here i'm gonna use my team and inside i will say background color
31:21
it's going to be white so let's use it and you can see better
31:26
after this icon i will say use this search component and i will say
31:32
search and it's here it's end of the screen that because we are using just five
31:37
content remember it's space between so if we create another component here you are gonna see that our search bar in the
31:45
center let's copy this and create one more and this time it's gonna be let's say
31:50
icon container or just icons and it's gonna be a box from material so let's
31:57
use it here icons and scrubby icons inside for now i'm just writing text and
32:04
as you can see this is our search bar and this is our icons box let's close here by the way and let's give some more
32:11
styles firstly i want to give some padding from top and bottom it's going to be zero left and right 10 pixels
32:19
and let's use our team i will say border radius let's give comma here by the way and
32:26
it's gonna be of course you can give any pixels here but i want to show you how you can use team
32:33
i will say team dot shape and border radius
32:39
and this time as you can see it's not sharp anymore it looks much much better
32:44
but it's really small let's give some width i will say width
32:50
and it's going to be 40 percent for example okay perfect of course there is no input
32:55
inside let's see how we can add i will search for
33:01
input and it's going to be input base and as you can see we can use all those
33:06
props so let's use it inside this search
33:11
instead of this text i will call input base and i will import
33:17
and let's give a placeholder and it's going to be just search
33:22
like that and right now we can see our padding better so what about these icons
33:28
i'm gonna create my icons first one will be mail okay let's use this one but before
33:35
i want to show you one more thing and it's gonna be page
33:40
so instead of using this icon alone we can give some batch as you can see it's
33:46
really easy to use only thing usually is giving here a number and its color and
33:52
our icon so i'm gonna copy this and paste inside icons is gonna be our first
33:58
icon let's import this page and mail
34:04
and let's see as you can see it's here by the way i'm gonna delete this color here and this
34:10
page color will be red so i can say error it's just like primary secondary
34:16
and success like that of course we cannot see that because our container is white i'm gonna delete this
34:24
and perfect and i'm gonna add one more page here i'll just copy and paste and
34:30
it's gonna be notifications let's import as you can see it's here
34:36
and last thing will be a letter it's going to be our user avatar it's
34:41
here as you can see it's a circle you don't have to create any div and give
34:46
border radius it's that easy we are gonna use only this component
34:52
so after this page i will say avatar like that let's import
34:57
and we should give our source i'm just gonna copy and paste this image
35:03
from pixels.com and as you can see it's really big let's give some style here i can use
35:10
inner style and let's say width 30 and height will be the same
35:17
okay it's much better but as you can see it's not horizontal i will say display
35:24
and flex like that and i can give some space between them so if you are using flexbox
35:30
you can just give here a gap it's going to be 20 pixels
35:36
like that it's much better by the way i can align them align items it's going to
35:42
be center okay they are centered vertically so let's take care about our mobile device
35:49
by the way it's still here i'm just gonna refresh my page okay
35:55
let's come here actually it looks okay but for more practice let's give
36:00
something else it's gonna be more useful for you so what i'm gonna do if it's a small screen i'm just gonna show this
36:07
author and maybe username we are not gonna see these notifications
36:12
let's do that const user box for example i'll say styled and it's going to be a
36:20
box actually i can just copy this one user box and again it's going
36:27
to be display flex a line item center maybe last cap
36:33
and i'm going to use it here after icons user box
36:38
and it's going to include our avatar let's copy this and also it's going to
36:44
be our username let's say john and variant will be
36:49
just like that so what i'm gonna do is giving
36:55
my display condition if it's small screen we are gonna delete this one and we are gonna show our user box
37:02
if it's bigger it's gonna be the opposite so how we are gonna do this here as you can see we are using team we
37:08
can use it and i will say team dodge breakpoints
37:14
and i will say up here and if it's small or bigger than small that's why we are
37:21
using up so i'm gonna say display flex
37:27
in this case if it's smaller than this breakpoint which is 600 it's going to be
37:33
displayed none it's that easy if i save and as you can see it's not here anymore
37:41
but if i open it's here so i can do the same thing for this box
37:47
so i will copy here and paste and this time if it's smaller than this
37:54
screen it's going to be flex if it's bigger than 600 it's going to be displayed not
38:00
like that let's showing this perfect
38:06
so what else we can do we can add here a button so when we click on this avatar
38:11
we can see our user menu and we can do this let's search for menu
38:18
and as you can see when i click this button it opens this middle it's that easy so i'm gonna show you how
38:26
we can use it so let's copy this one but it doesn't have any position here so
38:33
okay it's gonna be this one we can't give any position let's see
38:39
okay it's here as you can see it's gonna be on the top and left side
38:44
let's copy this one and under my toolbar i'm gonna paste it
38:51
and let's import them of course we are gonna apply everything later so i'm gonna delete those
38:58
functions here maybe item okay firstly is gonna be
39:03
true that because i'm just showing for now don't worry about that and position will be top and right so if we open our
39:12
application as you can see it's here so how we are gonna decide if it's open or
39:17
not it's really easy we can just create use state here after never i will say
39:22
const open set open
39:28
use statehook at the beginning it's gonna be false it's gonna be closed
39:34
and when we click our avatar or this user box it's gonna be opening so i can
39:40
see here on click event take the event and set my state it's
39:48
gonna be true i will do the same thing for mobile version which is user box
39:54
okay and i will come here and write here my closing method
40:00
it's gonna be on close and again set state
40:07
set open and it's gonna be false so whenever we click somewhere else
40:12
it's gonna be closing let's try i will refresh
40:19
of course we didn't write here our condition it's not gonna be true it's going to be depending on our state let's try i will
40:27
click and as you can see it's here and when i click somewhere else
40:33
it's go it's that easy so let's open mobile version
40:38
and i'm gonna click here perfect it works
40:43
so we've finished our nail bar you can also give menu for these icons maybe for
40:49
this search button if you have any search list you can use autocomplete let's come here
40:57
and check and as you can see it's not like a search button but you can write anything
41:03
here pulse fiction and it's gonna choose this element
41:09
it's really useful if you are searching from any list you can use this one also
41:14
as you can see only thing you should do is giving your list as a option like
41:20
that okay i'm not gonna show this because we don't have any functionality
41:25
it's just a design so let's take care our sidebar
41:30
so let's open sidebar so what i'm gonna do is adding a list
41:37
let's check here i will say list this one
41:44
and as you can see it's pretty nice we have an icon and text we can use this and
41:51
also you can use a nested list like that you can give additional text here and
41:58
other options this one is nice also you can use this in our right bar but for
42:03
now let's create this basic one i will open here
42:10
and as you can see list component and inside list item and we are gonna add our icon here and i'm gonna copy here
42:18
and paste like that of course i should close my list component here
42:24
like that so i'm gonna import them list
42:29
list item button and we are gonna change this icon i can
42:35
delete this and finally text
42:40
and it's gonna be let's say home page so for this button we can add a new
42:46
component remember how it works so we can do the same thing it's a list item button but
42:53
its html tag will be a so in this case we can give link here of course we don't
42:58
have any but just right here something like that okay let's add icon i will come here and
43:06
search for home page and this one is good we can use it
43:12
um and i'm gonna import let's see okay perfect
43:18
by the way we can delete this background color we don't need anymore of course you can change its color this
43:26
border shape it depends on you so i'm gonna add other items
43:31
okay i added other items here there is nothing important just texts and icons
43:39
let's see as you can see it's much better but i want to add one more lisp item
43:45
here and it's gonna be our dart mode option so i'm gonna come here and search
43:50
for switch button and as you can see we can use this basic
43:57
one let's see what else we can use as you can see you can use any color
44:03
here but let's use this basic one
44:10
so i'm gonna create one more list item and our icon will be let's choose here
44:18
moon this is good i think we can use this one instead of this icon i'm gonna
44:23
use mode knight and we are not gonna have any text i'm
44:28
gonna delete this instead we are gonna use switch okay perfect
44:35
of course we are gonna arrange our dark mode but for now it looks awesome let's
44:40
create some posts inside this feed of course you can come here and create
44:46
another component which is list item and you can pass it's link it's text and icon but i'm not
44:54
gonna do this let's open up feed i can close them to show our posts i'm gonna use
45:02
material ui cards let's say card there's a basic card
45:09
or you can add any image and those interactive buttons
45:15
what else okay it's similar so we can use this one
45:20
it looks awesome it can be our user we can like or dislike this post but
45:26
there's a accordion here we can just get rid of this it's gonna be only this card let's see how we can
45:33
use it okay i can copy here of course we are gonna change
45:40
and i'm gonna paste here let's import them cards i'm gonna delete here we don't
45:46
need any custom width cut header author if you want to use your
45:52
theme color you have to import this also but i will just basically right here red
46:00
icon button media and i'm gonna add here my image
46:05
let's use this free image again and it's gonna be our text content
46:11
and our actions which is like button share button
46:17
we don't need that we are not gonna expand our cart item and we can delete this
46:24
we don't have any additional description okay let's see
46:33
okay i forgot this icon where is that okay here
46:41
more vertical okay let's select this background color we don't need this anymore
46:49
and perfect what we can do we can increase this image size let's come here
46:54
and as you can see there is a default height here let's say 20 percent so in
47:00
this case if i go to mobile version it's gonna look much better and in desktop
47:05
version it's nice also it's that easy guys if you use only html
47:11
and css it will take probably 20 minutes half hour but thanks to material ui it
47:18
just takes one minute but i'm gonna add one more thing here as you can see if i
47:23
click this heart button it's not changing so instead of this button i'm gonna add here a checkbox
47:30
let's see how we can use it this is the basic checkbox of course we are gonna use
47:36
icon and here when i click this it's filling inside this button we can use it
47:43
and it's really easy to use you're just giving an icon with only order
47:48
and when you check it which means when you click it changes to another icon
47:54
let's copy this i'm gonna delete this and check box
47:59
you don't have any prop here and let's import this
48:05
and that's all let's see right now as you can see it's only border when i click it's going to
48:11
be blue heart you can change its color i will say color will be red
48:20
it's much better so what else we can do
48:26
we can add multiple posts but this time
48:31
let's create another component pause all jazz i'm gonna create my
48:36
function here quickly and inside it's gonna be this card let's
48:42
copy this here of course we are gonna need all those
48:47
icons and components like that you don't need box here
48:54
and also i can delete here and
48:59
i will delete everything but box right now i can call my component i will
49:07
say card sorry it was paused i will say post and in this case i can
49:13
use multiple posts like that okay perfect of course you can pass this username by
49:20
the way it's a recipe maybe let's say
49:27
john doe 2022 [Music]
49:32
okay i'm not gonna give any probe it's gonna take time we can't leave it like that but there is something more here
49:42
what we can do is adding here a margin it's really close so for this card i
49:48
will say margin
49:53
it's gonna be five like that it's much much better but as
49:58
you realize we have a problem here that because we cannot see our list here it's really easy to handle that let's open
50:06
sidebar again and i'm gonna give here a position but if i give this for this box
50:13
let's say position fixed as you can see it looks really strange
50:18
that because fixed positioning is acting like a position absolute
50:24
so instead of this i'm gonna create one more box inside and it's gonna be our
50:30
wrapper and we can use position safely
50:35
box and i'm gonna wrap my list here [Music]
50:42
like that and right now i can give position
50:48
fixed let's see right now okay perfect and i'm scrolling and it's still
50:56
here so i'm gonna copy here and i will do the same thing for right bar
51:03
i'm gonna delete this background color and i'm gonna create one more box here
51:13
and i'm scrolling and it's staying here and also our nail bar remember it was
51:19
sticky awesome it works so what we can add here
51:25
we can add our online friends let's do that i'm gonna add
51:31
let's say online friends and i'm gonna give a variant here
51:38
let's say h6 but it's really thick let's make this thinner to do that i can
51:44
directly give font weight here and it's gonna be let's say a hundred
51:51
it's gonna be the thinnest one but we are not using a hundred i think let's open up index.html
51:59
and as you can see we are using just three hundred four hundred and five i'm just gonna add here
52:05
a hundred two hundred in this case it's gonna be thinner okay
52:11
perfect right now let's add our friends
52:16
i'm going to open our water again but this time we are not going to use only one avatar we are going to use avatar
52:23
group let's check here and as you can see it's going to be like
52:28
that you can give max probe here as you can see it's four and when you add five avatars it's gonna
52:36
show four avatars here but when you add five quarters it's gonna be plus two
52:41
here so let's use here and i'm going to paste here
52:49
our group okay perfect but as you can see we don't have any
52:55
image to prevent this i'm going to copy and paste my avatars here
53:00
and max number will be seven okay if you don't give any image it's gonna show
53:06
this blank avatar let's check for this user there is no avatar it's
53:11
gonna be this image so what else we can use we can create here a portal gallery
53:18
let's check i'll say list but this time it's going to be image list and as you can see it
53:24
works like a grid system you can use more artistic one like this one
53:31
and others this basic one is totally enough and this is how it works
53:38
we are going to create image list for each image we are gonna create image
53:43
list item of course we don't have any list you can create a json file but again i'm
53:50
gonna do this one by one but before let's create another
53:55
text here another title and it's gonna be
54:01
latest posts or photos and after this i'm gonna create image list
54:10
and inside this i'm gonna paste my items let's import this also
54:18
okay and as you can see you can give any custom height here or column number in this example if it's
54:25
more than three images this list is gonna move them in another line like that
54:32
so columns will be three columns and row height will be
54:38
let's say a hundred like that and also
54:43
you can arrange those spaces to do that i will say gap if i say five
54:50
for example it's gonna be something like that okay
54:56
by the way we can give a padding for this box or we can give a custom width
55:02
that because it's really close to end of the screen so let's come here and for
55:07
this box let's give it for example
55:14
okay right now it's much better by the way we can give some margin for this text
55:21
i will say margin top let's say two and margin bottom is gonna be two okay
55:28
perfect and let's add one more thing here and it's
55:33
gonna be latest conversations so i will copy here
55:41
latest conversations
55:47
and remember we have seen a list here let's check
55:55
and i saw something here okay this one is awesome
56:01
exactly what i want let's see how we are using again we are using list list item
56:09
user avatars and other texts let's directly copy this actually
56:15
it looks pretty nice like that
56:21
and i'm gonna import them let's import everything we need like that i don't wanna waste time okay
56:28
let's see and awesome of course there is no image that because they are still
56:34
static we don't have any image but if you want to you can give
56:39
let's give one of them by the way i can delete this
56:44
margin bottom maybe and perfect what else we can do
56:53
we have posts but there is no button to add any post let's create a button and
56:59
create here a model so let's create another component inside components i
57:05
will say add.js my function
57:11
and i'm going to add this inside app.js let's edit here
57:16
i'll say add from components and let's close them
57:23
okay so what kind of button we are gonna use
57:28
let's search for tooltip as you can see it's just a button but
57:34
underneath there is a text but inside instead of icon we are gonna be using
57:40
anything else i'm gonna show you but before let's copy this i'm gonna paste it here by the way it's
57:47
not gonna be deep it can be just react fragments and i'm gonna import this tooltip
57:54
i'm gonna delete here and let's see something else and it's gonna be fab
58:01
and as you can see it looks much more better it has this default animation inside so
58:08
we can use it i will copy this and paste inside
58:16
fab it's going to be primary and my icon here is going to be add icon but i
58:22
cannot do this that because our component name is already add so i'm going to install add icon let's come
58:29
here and say import add as add icon
58:37
and it's gonna be mui and icons
58:43
let's see and it's gonna be somewhere here but we
58:50
are gonna give another position for this like absolute or fixed so it's gonna be
58:55
somewhere here let's do that inside this tooltip i will
59:01
say x and position will be fixed
59:06
and we are going to give some position here bottom will be let's say 20
59:14
like that and left side will be something like 30 but if we do this
59:21
and then we open mobile version it's gonna look a little bit weird so i'm
59:26
gonna move this in the middle of the screen so i can write here my condition i will say left
59:34
and if it's extra small we are going to need some calculation and i will say
59:41
50 percent x small if it's medium it's going to be just 30. and as you can
59:49
see it's somewhere here but it's still not in the middle of the center that because we didn't calculate its radius
59:56
here if i remember correctly it was 25 pixels so if i say minus 25
1:00:05
it's gonna be on the middle by the way we have extra space here it shouldn't be
1:00:11
like that we are gonna handle that but before let's take care of this button
1:00:17
so when i click this button i'm gonna create a model here that we can add our
1:00:22
posts to do that let's come here and model okay i will click and as you can
1:00:30
see it's opening i can use this i will copy this
1:00:37
and after this tooltip i'm gonna paste
1:00:42
let's import we are gonna have a box we don't need this style
1:00:49
and those text i'm gonna delete and i will just say hello of course we are gonna need our
1:00:56
state as we always do i'm gonna create open set open
1:01:04
and the initial state will be false it's gonna be close
1:01:12
and when i click on this button on click methods
1:01:19
it's gonna be set open and true so i can do the same thing for
1:01:27
close method and it's going to be false i will come here
1:01:33
i'm clicking and as you can see hello is here
1:01:38
but i don't want a full screen box so what i'm gonna do is giving some width
1:01:43
and height for our box and making this model display flex
1:01:49
what i mean by that let's come here and let's say
1:01:55
beat 400 height will be blue 80
1:02:02
or whatever you want let's give background color and it's gonna be white
1:02:08
and i will give some padding it's gonna be three and as you can see it's here
1:02:15
maybe portal radius
1:02:21
i'll say five okay it's better
1:02:27
but as you can see it's not centered so i can create my own model let's say
1:02:34
styled model and i'm going to create my own model here i'll say const model
1:02:43
is going to be styled model i should import this
1:02:51
and i will say display flex align item center
1:02:57
and justify content center let's see right now
1:03:04
okay perfect so let's create a title here inside this box
1:03:12
and create post i'm gonna give my variant
1:03:19
h6 and maybe color
1:03:25
let's say gray let's see okay it's here i can center this
1:03:31
i will just use text align it's gonna be center
1:03:39
oops equal okay so what i'm gonna do is creating here a user avatar and username
1:03:47
to do that again as we did before i can create userbox
1:03:52
and inside we are gonna have our avatar username
1:04:00
let's say john doe and font weight will be 500 and
1:04:08
its type will be spam import this and let's create our user
1:04:14
box i can copy this actually
1:04:21
it's going to be user box and again display flex and align item
1:04:26
center by the way it's gonna be box of course i will click
1:04:32
and as you can see it's here i can give some margin here to do that
1:04:37
remember if you are using flexbox you can directly give cap here let's say 10
1:04:43
pixels and i'm gonna give margin button
1:04:50
okay we have margin here right now i can add my text box here to
1:04:57
do that we are going to use text field as you can see we can use this one but i
1:05:05
want to add more rows let's come here as you can see multi-line we can use this
1:05:11
it's the last one i'm gonna copy and after this user box we can add
1:05:18
i'm gonna import and we don't need any label
1:05:24
let's see first okay instead of this default value
1:05:30
i'm gonna add placeholder it's gonna look better and let's say what's on your mind
1:05:39
maybe let's give full width to do this i'm going to use sx and
1:05:45
width will be let's say a hundred percent okay perfect
1:05:50
but it doesn't look it's a placeholder i'm gonna close and open again probably
1:05:57
didn't say okay perfect it looks awesome
1:06:03
maybe a little bit smaller
1:06:08
okay right now let's add here some icons to do this we can use
1:06:13
stack layout i will say stack remember it's a flexbox and we can give
1:06:20
a direction and it's gonna be raw and for each item i'm gonna give a gap and it's gonna be
1:06:27
one let's see i'm gonna add some icons first one will be
1:06:33
emoji icon this one like that
1:06:41
let's import if i duplicate this we can see better
1:06:46
okay as you can see like that and for this stack let's give some margin margin
1:06:51
top will be two and margin bottom will be let's say
1:06:56
three okay much better and for others it's gonna be
1:07:02
image it's gonna be this one video camera back
1:07:11
and add person
1:07:17
this one i'm gonna add them and i'm gonna give different colors
1:07:24
let's add directly like that i'm gonna import them
1:07:34
okay as you can see primary secondary success and error
1:07:40
like that and there is one more thing we should do and it's going to be our button but let's do something different
1:07:48
i want to show you different components as much as i can
1:07:53
and it's going to be button group as you can see you can use different buttons
1:07:58
like that let's copy this and after this stack i will say
1:08:04
button group and button it's gonna be post and second one will be just icon
1:08:14
which icon we are gonna use let's come here date
1:08:20
wrench we are gonna use this one so it's gonna be like a schedule of
1:08:25
course inside component like that and i'm gonna import
1:08:31
okay but i'm gonna make this full width to do this i will just come here
1:08:39
and fold it maybe we can arrange its size it's
1:08:44
really big it's just an icon so i will say
1:08:50
with it's going to be 100 pixels for example oops
1:08:56
of course inside button
1:09:01
okay i'm gonna open and it's here
1:09:06
perfect it looks pretty good so we can change our dark mode
1:09:12
you cannot imagine how easy to use it let's open up objects
1:09:18
and here i'm gonna create a team i will say const
1:09:24
dark team and it's gonna be create team
1:09:30
from material ui and here we are gonna use palette and inside we are gonna use mod
1:09:38
and by default it has two modes first one is dark and second one is light of
1:09:44
course we are gonna change it so we are not gonna use any of them i will say const mode
1:09:52
set mode and at the beginning it's gonna be light mode so i can use it
1:09:59
here and i'm gonna wrap my application i will
1:10:04
say team provider and let's wrap this box
1:10:16
like that and right now we are able to use our dark team
1:10:22
okay it's light at the beginning but what if i change this
1:10:30
and as you can see as soon as i do that all those components are changing
1:10:37
this card this list this nail bar we don't have to do
1:10:42
anything but we don't have any background it's really easy to handle
1:10:49
i will come here and i will say background color background
1:10:54
and default let's go like that if i do this
1:11:00
as you can see it's black but what about our texts i will do the same thing
1:11:07
i will say color this time it's going to be text dot primary
1:11:14
and right now it's white that because our primary color is white
1:11:19
if i open this as you can see it's still light let's go to add page and i will do the
1:11:27
same thing i will copy here and
1:11:32
there is our box okay it's here and instead of white
1:11:37
i will say background color default text color primary
1:11:44
it's that easy guys it's just one minute thing but how we are gonna change it i will
1:11:51
come here and again at the beginning it's gonna be light and
1:11:56
and i'm gonna set this inside this sidebar when i click this button it's gonna be dark mode when i click again
1:12:03
it's gonna be light mode let's send this will say set mode and it's gonna be set mode and
1:12:11
also i'm gonna send my mod because we are gonna compare
1:12:18
okay let's open up sidebar and i'm gonna take my props
1:12:24
mode and set mod let's come here so i'm gonna add here on
1:12:30
change event and i will say set mode and i'm gonna write my
1:12:36
condition i'm gonna look inside mode and if it's light
1:12:42
it's gonna be dark and if it's not light it's gonna be
1:12:48
light that's all let's see i'm clicking and dark mode
1:12:54
clicking again light mode perfect
1:13:01
of course we can give endless examples but it's just a crash course i believe
1:13:07
that you feel much more confident right now you can play around all those
1:13:12
components and after creating couple projects i'm sure that it's gonna be your favorite ui
1:13:19
library so let's deploy our application
1:13:25
it's really easy only thing you should do is writing here npm
1:13:31
run and build it's gonna take a while
1:13:36
and after that it's gonna create a build folder here as you can see it's here and
1:13:42
it's ready it includes our index.html and our static files
1:13:49
let's open our hpanel and here i'm gonna choose my hosting
1:13:55
i'm using this one and in this page i'm gonna scroll and
1:14:00
find file manager i'm gonna click
1:14:05
and as you can see this is our main file this is our default home page i'm gonna
1:14:12
delete this and i'm gonna drag and drop my files
1:14:19
into this folder let's choose them and i will drag
1:14:26
and drop here
1:14:32
and that's all it's ready it was just couple seconds
1:14:39
and it's ready as you can see it works let's check out our functionalities
1:14:46
okay it's working let's try dark mode this button here
1:14:52
it's that easy guys and as you can see our connection is secure that because we
1:14:57
are using https connection and that's all i hope you liked it
